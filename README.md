# Reddit to Spotify

Takes the top 20 songs submitted in Reddit's 'r/Music' subreddit (using 'music streaming' flair) in the last week and creates a Spotify playlist from them.

### How to use it?

* Input your Spotify username
* That's it!

#### Finding your Spotify username

Finding your Spotify username can be tricky.
A quick way to find it is to:
* Go to `https://play.spotify.com/collection`
* The page will redirect to another one. Now, look at the URL.
* Your username is just after the `/user/` part.
* Note that your username can be numbers if you registered via Facebook.
* e.g. `https://play.spotify.com/user/your_user_name_or_numbers/playlist/abc123`
